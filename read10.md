## Error Handling & Debugging

* JavaScipt interperter processses one line of code at a time. When  a statement needs data from another function it stacks the new function ontop of the current task.


Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:

1. Prepare

* The new scope is created
* Variables, functions, and arguments are created
* The value of the this keyword is determined

2: EXECUTE

* Now it can assign values to variables
* Reference functions and run their code
* Execute statements

* Functions in JavaScript are said to have lexical scope. They are linked to the object they were defined within.
