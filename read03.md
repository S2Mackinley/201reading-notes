# Reading Notes 3

## Chapter 3 "Lists" (62-73)

**There are three different types of lists**

1. Ordered Lists `<ol>` `<li>`
    * this is a list with every item numbered. like the one im making right now.
    * `<li>` (list item ) is where all your content would go when making a list.
2. Unordered lists `<ul>`
    * this are lists without numbers. like the one im using to describe the lists
    * the same `<li>`is used for unordered list. but the ul tells it that its unordered. so to not add numbers
3. Definition lists
    * these lists use a set of terms along with definitions for each of the terms.
    * `<dt>` `<dd>`
