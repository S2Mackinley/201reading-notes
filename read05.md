**Choosing Images**

Things to consider when choosing images

1. Choose relevant pictures
2. Sets the mood
3. Projects the mood
4. Easily recognizable
5. Flows with the color

Its always a good idea to put all images in a folder. You can group images that are alike in sub folders. For example you can make a sub folder called *interface* and add things like logos or buttons inside. Or a subfolder called products with product photos inside.

**Key Words For Images**

`<img>`

`src`

`alt`

`title`

* img is used to add the image. to source the image you use src. Alt is text that desribes the image incase the link to your image stops working. This also helps the blind. The title is used as a tooltip when you hoover over the image to give you more information.

`<img src="images/kangaroo.jpg" alt="a cute picture of a kangaroo" title=" The kangaroo carrys a baby inside of a sack on its belly." />`

where you place your image matters. If you place your image before  a paragraph `<img><p>` it will start the paragraph on a new line after the image. Placing the image inside the start of a paragraph `<p><img>` will align the bottom of the image with the first row of the text. The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it apears in if you place the image in the middle of a paragraph. Images are block elements. So no text will show next to an image. to get text to apear around you image you use the `align="left/right" /` to move the text around your image. You can also use top bottom or middle. Most of your images will be edited using Adobe Photoshop.

HTML5 added newer code with `<figure>` here you can place images and you can add captions under the image using `<figcaption>` inside the figure tag.
